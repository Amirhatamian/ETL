# ETL Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline implemented using Python. 
The pipeline extracts data from various sources, transforms it into a structured format, 
and loads it into a database for further analysis.

## Features

- Data Extraction: Gather data from multiple sources, including files, APIs, or databases.
- Data Transformation: Clean, filter, and transform raw data into an analysis-ready format.
- Data Loading: Store the processed data in a relational database for querying and visualization.

## Technology Stack

- Programming Language: Python 3.7.6
- Libraries:
  - pandas (1.1.3): For data manipulation and analysis.
  - sqlite3 (3.30.1): To manage SQL databases.

## File Structure

- Notebook: Contains the complete ETL workflow with explanations and code.
- Data: (Specify the location of input files, if applicable.)
- Database: SQLite database used to store the processed data.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher.
- Install required Python libraries:

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/etl-project.git cd etl-project

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook to review the ETL pipeline:
   jupyter notebook "ETL Project.ipynb"

3. Run the cells sequentially to perform the ETL process.

## Key Steps in the ETL Process

1. Extract:
- Load raw data from files or databases.
2. Transform:
- Clean missing or inconsistent data.
- Normalize and aggregate data as required.
3. Load:
- Store the structured data in an SQLite database.

## Results

The project outputs a clean and structured dataset stored in an SQLite database, 
ready for querying or integration with reporting tools.
