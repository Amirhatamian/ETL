Overview
This project demonstrates an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline implemented using Python. The pipeline extracts data from various sources, transforms it into a structured format, and loads it into a database for further analysis.

Features
Data Extraction: Gather data from multiple sources, including files, APIs, or databases.
Data Transformation: Clean, filter, and transform raw data into an analysis-ready format.
Data Loading: Store the processed data in a relational database for querying and visualization.
Technology Stack
Programming Language: Python 3.7.6
Libraries:
pandas (1.1.3): For data manipulation and analysis.
sqlite3 (3.30.1): To manage SQL databases.
File Structure
Notebook: Contains the complete ETL workflow with explanations and code.
Data: (Specify the location of input files, if applicable.)
Database: SQLite database used to store the processed data.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher.
Install required Python libraries:
Copy code
pip install pandas
Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/etl-project.git
cd etl-project
Open the Jupyter Notebook to review the ETL pipeline:
arduino
Copy code
jupyter notebook "ETL Project.ipynb"
Run the cells sequentially to perform the ETL process.
Key Steps in the ETL Process
Extract:
Load raw data from files or databases.
Transform:
Clean missing or inconsistent data.
Normalize and aggregate data as required.
Load:
Store the structured data in an SQLite database.
Results
The project outputs a clean and structured dataset stored in an SQLite database, ready for querying or integration with reporting tools.
